For Version 2:
I implemented a fancy UI (maybe not that fancy but whatever) for client side.
It's just me trying out my Console engine.
You can press 'n' when launching for what is required on the assignment for the traditional command interface.
Additionally, I write good documentation :)

Both client and server will use 127.0.0.1 as the default IP address if not specified in the command line.

The server will display the user and password stored on the disk because of debugging purposes.
*To DISABLE that, you can compile with Release mode in Visual Studio. *
